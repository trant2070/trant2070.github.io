			<p1>My Family<br>
			<br>
			<p>My family consists of My dad, my mom, my sister, and I. My dad is in his 50s and my Mom is in her 40s. My sister and I 
     	 		are students in CCA. My dad is from Vietnam and so is his family. My mom was born here in San Jose, CA, but her family is
			China. My sister and I are from San Diego and have lived for all of our lives. My dad came to the US shortly after the end
     			of the Vietnam War and lived in Stockton, CA for a long time.</p1>
