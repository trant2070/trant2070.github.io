             <p>My hobbies are playing the piano, video games, and cooking. <br>
             I have been playing piano for almost 10 years,<br>
             and I still play the piano to this day. In most of my free time, <br>
             I research computer parts to upgrade my computer o that one day I <br>
             I can finally build my dream PC. I also play a lot of online multiplayer <br> 
             video games with friends. I used to do sports but quit because I simply <br>
             did not want to do it, or I couldn't due to an injury.</p>
