			<p2>My Favorite Book and Why<br>
			<br>
			My Favorite Book the Game of Thrones because the book is a fantasy book thattakes place in a medival time, which is
			one of my favorite eras to study and read about. Not only that, you never  know what is going to happen because it 
			is not your typical story where you can easily predict everything that is going to happen. The book is about this 
			world where everyone is trying to controll the Seven Kingdoms by being the controller of the Iron throne. There are 
			many different characters and doesn't always just focus on one character. It goes from character to character showing
			you their point of view of every event that is happening. </p2>
			<br>
			<p3>Characters<br>
			<br>
			There are many different characters that show up throughout the book, but the characters that are key to the book so 
			so far are the Starks, the Lannisters, the Baratheons, and the Targaryens. There are however more families that will show up but for now, 
			these are the main families. The Starks of Winterfell live in the north and the family had contributed to the fall of the
			Targaryens with the help of the Baratheons. There are only a few members of the Targaryen family left after their fall. The Baratheons 
			are currently in control of the realm, but they are also married to the Lannisters and are in a power struggle. The Lannisters are
			well known for how rich they are and how "a Lannister always pays its debt." The Targaryens are known for their imfamous ruler the Mad King
			, but they were also known for their dragons.</p3>
